README.

I want to put here the code from the exercises from the book "Learning Python with the Raspberry Pi".

It's a great book and a good intro to Python but there is no source code from the book in Internet.

Some code have mistakes and is incomplete. Obviously these mistakes in the transcription of the code are exclusively mine. 

Anyway, if you can, buy the book. It's great.
